# Contributing

Thank you for working on goat. This page is the whole process; nothing else is required reading before your first pull request.

## The short version

1. Fork, or branch from `main` if you have write access. Branch names: `feat/<topic>`, `fix/<topic>`, `docs/<topic>`.
2. Make the change. Run the gates that apply (below). Add or update the design document in the same change when behaviour or topology changes.
3. Commit with a [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) subject and a DCO sign-off: `git commit -s -m "fix(zenoh): …"`.
4. Open a pull request against `main`. Fill the template. One approving review from a code owner merges it, by squash.

## Commits

- **Conventional Commits.** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`, with a scope in parentheses naming the component (`feat(goatbuilder): …`). The subject is ≤ 100 characters and says what changed, in the imperative.
- **DCO sign-off on every commit** (`git commit -s`). By signing off you certify the [Developer Certificate of Origin 1.1](https://developercertificate.org/): you wrote the change or have the right to submit it under this project's licence. There is no CLA.
- **Signed commits** are required on `main`; set up [SSH or GPG commit signing](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification) once.
- One logical change per pull request. Refactors and behaviour changes are separate pull requests.

## Gates

| Change touches | Run |
|---|---|
| a script | `shellcheck -e SC1090,SC1091,SC2086,SC2046,SC2034,SC2164 lib/onboarding.sh bin/hg-onboard scenarios/*/run.sh` |
| a scenario | `bin/hg-onboard all --offline` — every scenario walks to its summary with nothing run |
| a read or write step's behaviour | run the scenario against a goatnet (`--env <ctx>`, and `--for-real` with throwaway handles for a write) |

CI runs the first two. The third needs a goatnet; say in the pull request which one you ran it on.

## Review

Reviewers look for: the change does what its subject says and nothing else; the gates pass; the design document moved with the code; status words are honest; no identifier of a real deployment (an address, a hostname, a key, a person) entered the tree. Review comments are about the change, not the author.
